## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a **junior web developer in continuous progression**, focused on building and understanding **modern web applications**.

My main focus is **frontend development**, particularly with JavaScript and React, while I actively strengthen my foundations in **programming logic, algorithms, and computer science fundamentals**.

I value **clean structure**, **logical reasoning**, and **well-organized code**.  
My learning approach is strongly **hands-on**, using practical projects to deepen understanding rather than memorization.
